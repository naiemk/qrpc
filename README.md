# qrpc
RPC protocol through QR Codes

## Why?
Why do you want to use QR codes to call functions on a (not so) remote device when we have networks? Two reasons:

1. To communicate with an offline device. Holy grail of security is to take your device offline. You can use it to hold your private keys
2. In a Zoombie appocalypse all wifi routers might suddenly stop working. Your devices should still be able to communicate
